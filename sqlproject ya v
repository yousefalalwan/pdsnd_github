GROUP BY fullname, co.country
ORDER BY total_spending DESC, nb_of_payments DESC;

--Question 2:We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for.Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month.
